# Survival Analysis
This repo lists resources for doing survival analysis on time-to-event data. There is a huge volume of scientific literature, and books published on this topic. The intention is to list those that are accessible. To a certain extent, I shall also list resources that includes modeling data involving repeated measurements (longitudinal analysis).
